# Diabetes-prediction
A project by Verzeo to predict or classify wheether a patient have diabetes or not...


#Problem Statement:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
Do classification by at least 2 Algorithms.
#Dataset:
The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases with 768 entries.
Tools Used:
	Google Colab, Machine Learning Libraries.
#Algorithms:
	I have Implemented four Classification Algorithms
a.	Logistic Regression
b.	K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
c.	Decision Tree Classifier
d.	Support Vector Classifier
#Explanation:
	The Raw data set is not needed to be wrangled as it is already clean. Since the features of almost 8 columns vary with very large numbers I have used an Standard Scaling Technique to the Dataset and performed the above mention
